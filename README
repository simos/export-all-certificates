Export All Certificates,
by Simos Xenitellis <simos.lists@googlemail.com>

A Firefox extension that adds support to Firefox to export all root certificates with an easy way. 

Without this extension, you would need to save individual each of these root certificates (and there are over 150 of them).

This add-on asks you to specify a directory, and saves all the certificates in this directory. The filename is automatically chosen, and includes the canonical name of the certificate. You can then use programs such as openssl to read the details of each certificate.

Feel free to contact for support!
